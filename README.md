## About

### Purpose

**Defining the problem. **Not every day is filled with rainbows and birds chirping in your surroundings. People do have bad days, feel down, sad, discouraged or simply bored. When they are not feeling positive, *it is OK to be not OK*, it is part of being human that we have emotions. 

***How You Doin?*** (HYD) is a terminal app that aims to provide entertainment to the user, in the form of jokes (dad jokes to be specific üôÇ) and also positive encouragements as a relief or comfort when they are feeling unwell emotionally.   

HYD is inspired by Joey's famous pickup line from the sitcom *Friends*. Although he says it flirtatiously and cheekily, it never fails to make the other party laugh or smile every time he says it. It will be ambitious to guarantee users to laugh after using the app (especially with dad jokes!), they may groan, but at least they *respond* to it! And hopefully, HYD can provide some sort of relief, comfort, or at least a smile and make the user feel better, and then motivates the user to *respond* to any negative feelings they are currently facing, positively.

The app also features to record a log of how the user is doing (feeling) when and after using it, so they can track their own mental wellbeing. When needed, HYD also responds to the user by providing mental health facts and advice as their call to action. 

### Target Audience

Ideally anyone in their 20s to above, who can read English, who is bored or having a bad day, who needs relief and entertainment, who definitely appreciate dad jokes!

### Features

##### Control Flowchart

![HYD control flowchart](./docs/hyd_app_flow.png)

##### Pseudocode

At the start of the app, a welcome and general app info (what it is and how to use it) is displayed.

The user is asked to enter a unique name or nickname to be used to login next time and to access their log (at this point, password is not available yet).

User then is greeted with their name and asked, "*How you doin (feeling), today?"*

Other than to provide relief and entertainment to the user, the app also functions to track the user's feeling. There are two entry points for keeping track of 'today's entry', below is the first entry, and when they decide to 'call it a day' (end the app), the last one is prompted to update their feeling.

There are two categories of feelings that the user can choose (the two category names are not visible to the user, only for back-end purpose):

- *Alert/Concern* category:
  - Sad
  - Stress
  - Angry
- *Normal* category:
  - Bored
  - Just OK
  - Happy

The two main Entertainment info and options are displayed:

- ***How about a laugh?***
  - When chosen, a male speech/speak function can be enabled to read out the joke
  - A (randomised) dad joke is displayed, and if it is a dad joke question, the answer is revealed after a few seconds delay
  - Every joke will prompt a response:
    - üôÅ  üòÜ
  - Subsequenty, three options are available:
    - More laugh
    - How about an encouragement?
    - Call it a day
- ***How about an encouragement?***
  - Generally the same as above, except a female speech/speak function can be enabled to read out the encouragement and also the exception of response prompting to every encouragement (with the smileys)
  - Subsequenty, three options are available:
    - More laugh
    - How about a laugh?
    - Call it a day

When the user calls it a day, the last entry point is prompted to update how their feeling, after displaying *"So, user_name... How you doing (feeling) now?"*

- *Alert/Concern* category:
  - Worse
- Same-same
- *Normal* category:
  - Better

The last 7 entries of the log is displayed according to the date, day, time and their feelings before and after. The user can navigate to the next screen to move on.

If the user's current feeling is in the *alert/concern* category, a mental health facts and advice is displayed.

- The information is displayed to cater for the user's initial entry: sad / stress / angry
- A helpline number is also displayed

A thank you for using the app is displayed with short copyright and credit info. The app will automatically exit in a few seconds.

### User Interface, Interaction & Enhancements

The tone of the app is positive, chill and friendly. The chosen words throughout the app will be sensitive and considerate. For example, not using the word 'quit' to end the program, preventing any harmful negative thoughts for the worse-case scenario.

2. ASCII art generator for each page *(TTY font)*
3. Tables implementations for displaying log entries *(TTY Table)*

6. Colors *(Rainbow)*
7. JSON
