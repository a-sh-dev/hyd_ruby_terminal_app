### Purpose

***How You Doin?*** (HYD) is a terminal app that aims to provide entertainment to the user, in the form of jokes (dad jokes to be specific üôÇ) and also positive encouragements as a relief or comfort when they are feeling unwell emotionally.   

The app also features to record a log of how the user is doing (feeling) when and after using it to track their mental wellbeing.

HYD is inspired by Joey's famous pickup line from the sitcom *Friends*. He may say it flirtatiously and cheekily, but it hardly fails to make the other party laugh every time he says it. It will be ambitious to guarantee users to laugh after using the app (especially with dad jokes!), but hopefully, it will provide relief, comfort, or at least a smile and make them feel better.

The tone of the app is chill and friendly.

### General Features

#### Record *how user doing (feeling)* before and after using the app in a log

- Log is saved under user's unique name/nickname
- Log entry details include date & time
- The last 5 entries of the log is displayed before quitting the app
- HYD keeps track on the user's feeling category before and after using the app and responds accordingly before quitting
  - Two feeling categories at the start of the app:
    - *Alert*: sad / stress / angry
    - *Normal*: bored / just ok / happy
  - Feeling categories at the end of the app:
    - *Alert*: worse
    - Same-same (nothing change) 
    - *Normal*: better

#### Entertainment

##### *"How about a laugh?"* 

- Randomise (dad) jokes
  - The user can randomise as many times they want

  - Content can be spoken out (speech/speak features)

  - Back-end features:
